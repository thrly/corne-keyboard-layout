# Corne (crkbd) keyboard layout

keymap layout for 46-key CRKBD (v4.1)

![overview plan of keymap](./ot-corne-4-1-full-layout.png)

For those unfamiliar, the Corne (aka CRKBD) is a split 'ergonomic' keyboard, with 3x6 staggered ortholinear columns and 3 thumb keys.

## Considerations

Following [Mark Stosberg](https://mark.stosberg.com/markstos-corne-3x5-1-keyboard-layout/), I have a few initial considerations for a keymap that works _for me_:

- Maintain broad similarity to 'regular' keyboards. I'm not always using my corne, and moving between keyboards can be frustrating. That means keeping it QWERTY.
- Simple layers where possible.
- Programming. I'll be using a lot of symbol keys, so they need to be arranged logically and easily accessed.
- Blank keycaps (aesthetics seemed to take precedent during build, and I'm too stubborn to back down now). Keys need to be arranged in a way that makes sense to learn, and easy to remember.
- Learning to type on a split keyboard is a nightmare. I'm practicing with [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/)

## My keyboard

I'm using crkbd v4.1 pcb, the 46-key version, with hotswappable (MX) Outemu v3 Silent Peach (linear) and Silent Lemon (slightly tacticle) switches.
I'm using the [VIAL](https://get.vial.today/) firmware.
